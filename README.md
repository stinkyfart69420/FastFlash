You just select the distro, and it downloads and flashes it to your usb with ease.

# How to use.

First, go ahead and run the following commands in your terminal.

```
git clone https://github.com/stinkyfart69420/FastFlash
```
Now, you may go into the FastFlash directory that was just created, and then run
```
python3 main.py
```

You should see something like this.

(note: your drive should show up as sdb, sdc, sdd, etc.)

After that, you will get a warning saying that your USB will be wiped. Make sure to backup all data before proceeding.

Now once you get into a menu that looks like this, delete all the partitons, and then write the changes.
