FASTUSBFLASH

Here are some of the features FastUsbFlash can do:

# Download your favorite distro with ease.

Now with FastUSBflash, you have the option to download all of your favorite distros with NO ADS and without opening a web browser.

You just select the distro, and it downloads and flashes it to your usb with ease.

# How to use.

Once you downloaded the main.py file from this repo, go ahead and execute the main.py file with sudo.

"sudo python3 main.py"

After that, you are in the script.

Now once you get to this screen that you see right here:

You MUST delete all the partitions.

After you have done that, it should look like this:

Now go ahead and write the changes, and then quit.

After that, the distro of your choice will flash to your USB.
